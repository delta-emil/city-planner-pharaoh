# City Planner - Pharaoh

A city planner tool for the classic Pharaoh city builder game.

# TODO

- load terrain from save file
- fix scolling map view when the main toolbar is touched
    - maybe don't have separate secondary toolbars?
    - this was happening on select if a road is affected - when the road lenth was updated in the top toolstip - and AutoSize=false fixed it,
    so that might be a good plan
- nicer display names for buildings
- undo/redo
- fix Fort irregular shape

Low prio:

- Copy-Paste Terrain
- hold Shift to paint Terrain in a rectangle
- keyboard shortcuts
- button icons
- export to image/html/glyphs(?)
