A city planner tool for the classic Pharaoh city builder game.

# TODO

- scroll position is still being annoying.
  this time when you tab in and out, when the window gets repainted.
  might need to just do the scrollbars manually at this point.
- nicer display names for buildings
- undo/redo
- fix Fort irregular shape

Low prio:

- Copy-Paste Terrain
- hold Shift to paint Terrain in a rectangle
- keyboard shortcuts
- button icons
- export to image/html/glyphs(?)
